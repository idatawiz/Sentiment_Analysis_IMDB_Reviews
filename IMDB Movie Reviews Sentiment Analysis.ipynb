I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.\",\n",

I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won\\'t ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It\\'s a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing .

It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer!

When you surround even the most talented people with Yes Men the result is often inferior. Such is the case with this movie. The story is told through semi flashbacks and a jumping time narrative. What results is unsatisfying and what is seen has very little depth. They try to paint two historical figures back and forth as flawed protagonist yet fail in the delivery.\",\n",

Outside the lighting, which was good, the cinematography was poor with unimaginative framing and very little use of creative angles or motion. I think Nolan thinks that the IMAX format somehow automatically makes the cinematography special and artistic and he single-handily proves that notion wrong with this film (as well as Dunkirk).\\n\\nNonetheless, it will find its way into a nomination/and or for Best Picture because of the emperor's new clothes.\",\n",

Not to mention Murphy who underacts just perfectly. Just wow... Even extras are famous in this movie...\\n\\nEditing and soundtrack are the two other significant reasons of Oppenheimer's success. Nolan is and was always surrounded with great crew members and post staff.

Don't believe all those mocking reviews which say you need to know physics for this, absolutely not. Basic knowledge of science is enough and you get the context of stuff going on but yes you need to pay attention. Don't put your mind on those free refill popcorns and drinks.

The cinematography, the musical score, the depth of characterization were all good. I only have one criticism, which is that the jumbled chronology of scenes made it kind of confusing for someone who wasn't paying attention or for someone who didn't have a basic knowledge of the story. However, the black and white shots coupled with the various location settings helped with this. Overall, an excellent film with a very important message: History is made by flawed and complicated people, who sometimes do bad things for good reasons, which can have both rewarding and terrible effects.\",\n",

It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end.',\n",

The story itself doesn't need three hours to be told. The film also started in high speed and ended in high speed.

Do words, does dialogue really matter when you are retelling how the fear of violence from one side pushed the other to unleash the most deadly and brutal attack on Japan. This is a well written movie though the ending is disappointingly cliche for a Nolan screenplay. Around the two hour mark. It felt like it was getting boring. It might benefit from some cuts.

The last hour of the movie and especially the last few minutes before the credits roll are haunting and will sit with you.\\n\\nCillian Murphy is just amazing. I have always been such a fan of his acting and I am glad he's getting his flowers by being recognized for this role. Robert Downey Jr was chilling as Lewis Strauss.

There is a lot of time devoted to a hearing to determine whether Oppenheimer gets to retain his security clearance.

Glorifying the smartest people creating the biggest bomb after the worlds best scientific discovery was sickening. I know that was true, but it made me sick. Showing how twisted and demented our government is was a great idea. There is literally too many things i want to say but don't know how to word them.

A masterpiece and a future classic for sure.\\n\\nSynopsis: During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history.\",\n",
       "  'This movie is like solid 8 but really not easy to understand. There are several layers like politics, moral, family, history, science and if you want to get the full experience you might need to be like 60-70 years old professor from US who has vivid interest in politics and is really open-minded. Seriously, I was prepared although not falling into this category but most of the audience I think did not understand a lot as they were too young and politically fragile. And that is not even touching the morals of the story or ancient history mentioned briefly. Or consequences for the Japanese that were so terrible. Go there, watch and come back to this movie in 10-15 years again if you are under 45.',\n",

The war is always far off and distant, the impact on Japan only briefly mentioned, and the real person we are to have sympathy on is the title character. Even the building of the bomb lacked the challenge and exploration that it could have. It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter and even shorter focused less on the communism angle. While it hinted at why the bomb may have not needed to be dropped, since the viewer is left with no understanding of the state of the war with Japan it feels like more of an intellectual discussion than an in the moment approach to bringing the world's worst war to a close.\",\n",

If you are ready to learn about the politics of the time mostly via dialogs, this movie may be for you. Nolan's work was always visually inspiring as well and had a good balance between dialogue, action and visuals. In this case the balance felt off. It's like one of those extended director's cuts when they really try to include everything even tho it comes with the loss of momentum.

From the promotions of this film, I thought Robert Downey Jr. Would play a side role, but his role was almost as important as the lead character in this movie.

If not the best, we will soon see, but I doubt it. This might not be my favorite Nolan film, but it might be his best and most Oscar-worthy.

It is based on a book and reading history might also be something you would enjoy. I was a little surprised at the style. A little chaotic and loud. It all comes together, though. One character, an ordinary (seriously smart) man called by unusual circumstances to participate in one of the greatest events in contemporary history. It also tells why anyone would ever do such a thing, for it is quite awful in every sense.

Perhaps at the end of the year it will turn out that Oppenheimer will be the best film that 2023 has produced and if not it will definitely end up in the top 3.

They are Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. They impress in the film, but the rest of the cast also does an excellent job under the wing of Christopher Nolan. The soundtrack may not be as memorable as Tenet's or let alone Interstellar (of course Interstellar was made by Hans Zimmer), but all the elements are on board and the crackle of the Geiger counter under the music really adds power and gets completely under the skin. If you get the chance to visit the film in IMAX, it is absolutely recommended, but if there is no IMAX theater nearby, the regular silver screen will also suffice.

Both it's strength and it's weakness, is the subject matter about the controversies surrounding the atomic boom: it will seem like an old rehash by many viewers, and like a fresh look to others.

No family back-story, none of the quirks of his character as a young man, just a series of short episodes in labs while music plays incessantly and too loudly. Jumping back and forth in time, to create a sense of mystery to demonstrate a great man taken down by pettiness. You can't make this movie without hitting some high notes and the test scene brilliant, and the sense of moral regret is well delivered. But the overall production, especially the editing, and the focus on the 'trial' and the decision to omit the early back-story years, creates a gap that is never quite filled, despite the brilliance of Cillian Murphy portraying a man struggling with the impact of what he has unleashed on the world, not to mention a host of fabulous cameos.\",\n",

The sound design was one of the best I have heard in recent times. What impressed me the most was the restraint and subtlety exercised while telling this story. In hands of any other director, this could have very easily become a jingoistic and pathos-inducing average movie. So many of Nolan's stories work because of the emotions and bonds behind all the other stuff but i found that part a bit lacking here and that would be my only critique.

Let's begin with the obvious: this is 100% Nolaned; the script is clean and meticulous; Robert Downey Jr stands out for best acting followed by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt; Matt Demon isn't credible; the music is too insidious; the visuals and the story itself aren't worthy of a big screen. Now that the most evident is dissected, here is the trick. The movie portraits an American patriot that oscillates between pride and guilt with enough elements to pull in both directions simultaneously. And when you think the script was a straight line without twists (and you would be right), subplots emerge to at least complete three hours of dialogues with emoted tension and resolution in the life of a scientist, the father of the atomic bomb, turned both monster and hero.

Cillian Murphy as Dr. Oppenheimer is absolutely perfect in this title role. I enjoyed watching his brilliant talent while acting the various complexities about this historical character who is a flawed human being but, with his intuitive intelligence, became responsible for leading the World War II secret Manhattan Project and launching the world into the atomic age. I learned a lot of history by watching this film, although some scenes were surprisingly adult and unanticipated in the roll out of the plot. Robert Downey Jr., was exceptionally well cast as the difficult character Lewis Strauss who was a political man who, in my opinion, would have been lost to history without Downey's superb portrayal. Oppenheimer is a movie that will generate a renewed historical interest, and ethical discussions about how the atomic age transformed world politics and impacted the earth's environment.\",\n",

How easy it would be for the world to be destroyed at the push of a button is in a way fascinating but at the same time terrifying.

A true technical achievement. RDJ was absolutely brilliant in every scene he was in as well as other actors. Everyone was cast perfectly. But the jewel in the crown is without a doubt Cillian Murphy.

I do wish there would have been much more of a focus on the criminal devastation inflicted upon the people of Japan. Also, deduction for the sex and nudity - WHY do movies do this?

The dial was overlayed with 'music' or sounds for almost the whole film, even when just two characters were conversing. There were sections of dialogue in the film which I will never know as they were impossible to discern being drowned out by the accompanying sound. Disappointing.\",\n",

Its an overly long movie that at times confuses the viewers with flashbacks, BW to Color changes, historical liberties and political correctness. Don't get me wrong, This is the real Hitler and real Nazis and real antisemetism. But the whole latter half of the movie were Oppenheimer is disgraced due to his links to communism is overwrought. Didn't need to know how much of a philanderer he was. Could have fleshed out his relationship with the other scientists. At times too many characters. Good portrayal of Edward Teller.\\n\\nNot a date movie. Any nerd has working knowledge of this man. Nothing new revealed.\",\n",

He is dumb to lock himself in that iron man suit. The man just produced sick, sick....sick performance. The black-and-white cinematography with his performance, facial expressions, his voice ... oh my darling god.\\n\\nNolan, we own you so much on your work. You are the star.

The performance of each of the actors is impressive, they all create a perfect tune that catches you in the plot. Expectations were extremely high with Cillian Murphy's performance, however he has been able to far exceed them with a superb performance. I have rarely seen an actor interpreting a historical character in such a deep way, in which for a moment you forget that it is Cillian and you really think that you are seeing Oppenheimer on the big screen. This gives a great added value to the film. In my opinion, Oppenheimer falls into Nolan's top 3 films, ranking it in the first place would be somewhat pretentious having only seen it once. Without any doubt in the following weeks I will return to the cinema to see this masterpiece again.\",\n",

Special mention fro the sound artists of this movie. This is definitely getting nomination or maybe even winning oscars in these departments 1) murphy acting 2) Nolan direction 3) SOUND ENGINEERING\\n\\nKeep making such wonderful movies Nolan, more power to you.',\n",

Even for a biography film, he managed to turn it into an epic movie that can't be watched just once.\\n\\nI might say this is the biography film with the most realistic set locations I've ever seen. Watching Oppenheimer is like witnessing a classical Mozart piano performance: it's hard to understand if you don't grasp the context behind it. Perhaps in a fictional film, the filmmaker would gladly explain to us what's happening, but a biography assumes that we already understand the subject's background. I might watch it for the second time after relearning the background of J. Robert Oppenheimer.\",\n",

I am therefore looking forward to the DVD release so I can watch it again - with the sub titles turned to ON! I also expect the cut scenes that didn't make the movie to help explain some of 'in my opinion' the missing links to the story. I considered it should have covered more detail about 'the bomb' and its development. I'm sure there will be many Oscar nominations from the film including Best Film, Best Leading Actor and Best Supporting Actor in Matt Damon but certainly not Sound!!! Overall - very disappointing. Oh, I forgot, an Oscar nomination for Ludwig Goransson for his music as it dominates the movie.\",\n",

Oppenheimer is also very slow-paced, but it does not suffer from it, like other movies. But the people who enjoy these kinds of films are going to love this one. The movie does an amazing job of putting us in the eyes of J. Robert Oppenheimer and exploring the mind of a physicist, filled with inspiration, anxiety and fear. What binds this movie together is the score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. It's like flows with the movie like a river and entangles itself with the story. Another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan that makes us question the world we live in, gives us a true fear of Nuclear Weapons and is a must-watch in the theatre.

The story is portrayed in an incredible, tense and dynamic way. I like the fact that it is dynamic because it manages to hold the viewer well even in moments that would be calmer or even a little boring in other stories, but here everything is done very well for you to hold. One thing that helps to keep you hooked is the incredible interpretation of the actors, giving life and high realism to their characters and I especially highlight Cillian Murphy who is the soul of Oppenheimer. The film manages to convey the feeling of the scene very well, especially seconds before the explosion, making us feel in the protagonist's shoes and what helps is the fact that Nolan has not used any CGI the whole film, so it makes us anxious for the result as well as Oppenheimer and his co-workers.\",\n",

The movie is a biography, all of it on Robert Oppenheimer. A conversational experience that is one of the most enjoyable. This is the strength of the movie. It is the language of dialogue between the actors. This is the basis of the movie. Not to mention the scenes of the nuclear bomb, which I classify as one of the best scenes that I could have seen in my life, the powerful acting, and more than expected from Robert Downey Jr. The whole experience is more than wonderful, and we must not forget the soundtrack from heaven, and I expect an Oscar for this music.',\n",

Probably one of few movies with top tier actors, and delivers. But movie wise it's too thin. The bit that bothered me the most was the editing. So fast paced.

Everything was great and it is considered an injustice if the movie got less than two Oscar.

I could have got the same effect by grabbing a can of petrol and lighting it and filming it in slow motion and passing it off as a nuclear explosion. To say it was a bit crap is an understatement! It's a shame that nobody involved in the making of this film looked at actual footage. And it's not like there isn't enough of it about either, so there's no excuse. The story of Oppenheimer is ok.

More than that, the film was going in many parallel timelines which was involved in each other and trying to make more complicated but still the film is still smooth and without any peak point. The atomic explosion was not what we expected and there was nothing special about it. Florence Pugh had marvelous acting, but those rate R scenes badly overshadow her acting. And those scenes were unnecessary and not up to Nolan's style.\",\n",

Robert Oppenheimer acts under a purely genius mind to build the atomic bomb, focusing merely on theory with paying almost no attention to the deadly consequences. In the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki apocalypse, he makes his best to clear his conscience. Oppenheimer stands out as one of the most important films of this season. There may be a single flaw comes along with Nolan's choice of nonlinear story telling which mixes the power of the catharsis effect. Nevertheless giving Christopher Nolan's filmography, we are lucky to have such brilliant director following the paths of Kubrick.\",\n",

The xenon IMAX experience i can say was sub par and that seriously affected my viewing experience. Nevertheless the tightness of the dramatic story telling made me hooked to the screen with unflinching attention. Not even the loud snoring of my neighbouring seat fella could divert my attention. Cilian's best performance till date and an equally matchingnone by RDJ too. The movie rightly leaves an afterthought which is indeed a horror of sorts. Nothing so visibly horrific, but an underthemenof horror in it's telling. I seriously wish I had a 70 mm IMAX in my country to experience this in it's full glory. Defenitely missed out on that part. Nolan's take on a biopic in his narrative style and prowess of movie making defenitely makes this one of the best biopics in the history of cinema.

The story was ambiguous, as was the history and the impact on the world. And the opening, which tries to convey thought per se, is stunning. I saw the 35mm film, which was how the director wanted it to be shown and the imagery was overwhelming; merely imagining living with these thoughts is humbling.\\n\\nThere is no gore or bloodshed, no overt violence, just the barbarism of humans, whether from incinerating weapons or devastating pieces of paper, or calculated betrayal and jealousy. This is the best film of the year.\",\n",

It's okay to not meet expectations, but watching this in iMax 70mm upon second viewing, you care to think whether those disappointed would have changed their mind if they viewed this marvel of a movie in the intended screen and aspect ratio as nolan intended.\\n\\nI also think nolan has slowly revolutionalized the general movie goers expectation by creating peak cinema. No reason big blockbusters are flopping. Hopefully, we get more movies shot on film and broadcasted in format which although is expensive, is necessary to revive general people going to cinema rather than escape the comforts of their home.\",\n",

Before releasing, there was a hype about this movie because of Oppenheimer use the Geeta phrase after dropping the bomb by US army that was a reason, I was curious about to watch this movie but if you are not aware about physics & history, my suggestion for you do some RND first then you can watch this movie otherwise you will going to sleep on the chair.

The score mad meme feel ways I have never felt before, and the build up to the trinity test was an experience I wish I could endure again for the first time.

Christopher Nolan is the best director of modern cinema, only few can be with him on the same stage. Cillian Murphy must have his Oscar for this, it was just perfect. The most thrilling and beautiful moment was in the end, when whole audience just started the applause. I will never forget this movie and this IMAX experience. I highly recommend EVERYONE to watch it in IMAX, drive somewhere, If you don't have IMAX in your town.\",\n",
       "  \"This film is excellent all the way around. I always liked Nolan's work, but this one cemented me as viewing him as a great filmmaker period, and not just a great blockbuster filmmaker. The script is extremely sharp and the stand out performance is Cillian Murphy who really puts his heart into the role. It does not feel like 3 hours and even though I knew a lot of the story, it was still very engaging and enjoyable. This one honestly rivals Memento and The Dark Knight for me as Nolan's greatest achievement. I would say it's even better than the Batman trilogy because the script is so much sharper. Don't walk, run to see this one in theaters!\",\n",
       "  \"Dear God, if you can see it in IMAX 70mm, do it. The ability of Nolan's team to recreate Trinity in a way that makes you feel the full force of its consequences in one beautiful and terrifying sequence is masterful.\\n\\nI could say so much more, but honestly it doesn't need much prefacing. Nolan does a pretty solid job of not glorifying or vilifying Oppenheimer and presents the story with as much context as he can.\\n\\nWhile diversity is never Nolan's strong suit, it makes sense in the context of a historical film where the story has to focus largely on *mostly white men constructing the gadget.\\n\\nMurphy is excellent, but Downey's somewhat limited screen time is a tour de force and Oscar worthy as well.\",\n",

It never stops, and it's very loud, a true assault of the senses. Second, its pacing is crazy-making slow. Even 20 minutes into it, I was thinking 'this has got to get better, right?' Only it never does. The dialog is difficult to hear (largely over the loud music that never stops), and the storyline is not easy to follow. But besides all this, it's just a shockingly boring movie. I'm a big movie fan, and this will go down as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.\",\n",

In between I watched with amazement as the first 70mm IMAX movie I've seen blowing me away with visuals and sounds and emotions I've never quite felt in a theater before. This movie is an experience unlike all others I've seen in my life.\\n\\nI'm not a critic. I'm not here to break down the themes of science or morality. I'm here to tell you to watch this movie on the biggest, best screen you can and let yourself be absorbed by it.\\n\\nThe one thing I can assure you is you need to see this at the theater. There is no way this is going to have the same visual effect at home. Do yourself a favor see it now.\",\n",

The movie's technical aspects were flawless.\\n\\nHowever, I didn't find the movie to be as engaging as I had hoped because of its genre. Action, thriller and suspense movies are often my favourites. Therefore, I wasn't thoroughly entertained. Usually in Nolan movies you get truly invested in plot, however, I didn't find the case with this one.\\n\\nIn conclusion, movie is cinematic masterpiece. However, I'm afraid to say that you won't love it as much if you have entertainment expectations similar to those of Inception, Interstellar, and Dark Knight. Recommended, but it is a one time watch.\",\n",

The soundscape is just what to expect from a Nolan film, with a good soundtrack and great sound effects. I would recommend watching the film with a good sound system for the best experience.

The soundtrack is overpowering and extremely emotionally manipulative. It's as if the composer was asked to illustrate in sound how the audience should feel at every single moment. It made me think of opera...specifically Richard Wagner's theory of the Gesammtkunstwerk where all of the arts work together to provide a super sensory experience beyond any reality. The sound (or music) is meant to communicate with your subconscious as opposed to your conscious mind. But I sometimes became all too conscious of the soundtrack and found it distracting. That's why I rate this film at an eight. Nevertheless this is a must-see film and I thank the filmmakers for giving us something very worth watching.\",\n",

The storylines, the pilot drama in black and white, the historical creation of the bomb, the Security clearance Hearing and the flashbacks from Oppenheimer's life go hand in hand and support each other well. The movie does a great job of laying the complexity of the ethical debate around the creation of the bomb and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, without taking sides. However don't be surprised if the movie leaves you without the pure area of an Inception, Interstellar, or TeneT. Less questions are left open and more depressing topics are explored. Overall definitely worth the money and time.\",\n",

The movie left me awestruck, pondering the potential consequences of advancing technology.

When the scene ended, it felt like I had held my breath for minutes. In terms of special effects, it is the best film of the 21st century. The performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt are Oscar-worthy. But the rest of the gigantic cast is brilliant as well.

All the cameos are out of place along with the sex scenes. Nolan should never be allowed to cast another movie. He got lucky with Heath Ledger. If you liked this movie then you're pretentious and a sucker. 20 year old documentaries on the subject are more interesting. If want a Nolan/atom bomb sized explosions...you'll be very disappointed.

I found the editing work to be amazing, and I really hope it will be nominated for the Oscars for that. The casting is fabulous, the direction is grandiose, Cillian Murphy is superb, and the music and sound design are outstanding. All the images illustrating the quantum world are magnificently illustrated by a sound design that will give you chills. The Trinity sequence puts you in a crazy tension.

I really don't know how I'm going to be able to watch any other piece of cinema without comparing it to Oppenheimer. Lately movies haven't been doing it for me lately I feel like the directors are always trying to push something down our throats and feel cheaply made, this movie is different we are truly lucky to be alive during Cristopher Nolans reign. I think he will go down as the best director of all time if he keeps quality of movies up.\",\n",

While his other movies, like The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and Tenet have a lot of action, this film strays away from that (in a good way). By the end, their were two important things that I took from this movie. #1) It was basically all dialogue and score. With that being said, it's also a picture perfect example on how a movie can be so enthralling with just those two things. #2) I'm predicting some Oscar nominations in the future, specifically from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and RDJ. More specifically, the last 30 minutes belong to Cillian and Robert's acting! Hats off to them! While it does certainly feel like the entire 3 hours, it will instantly grab your attention and never backs down.

The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.\\n\\nI think its over-hyped.

Crazy because the topic, the execution and sequence of how Nolan presented what was a real life event and the consequences of it that we inherited today is gonna make you think a lot. I can easily say that many movies can be excellent, but only few can be exceptional and Oppenheimer is one of them.

Save your money and watch in ordinary screen, no need of going for IMAX. It's a dialogue heavy and totally a dialogue driven movie. Don't expect great visual as per the current going hype.

The movie is set at a period when philosophy mattered as much as physics for a scientist. The movie is all about one person who sees the world around him differently. This visionary genius is now under the terrible predicament of finding the most horrible weapon for the greater good which also happens to be his passion, nuclear fission. The same predicament which Krishna put himself under to instigate destruction. Sadly, he is also put on trial for his exact achievement later. So, He has to bare the cross and get crucified for it! Cillian Murphy recreated Oppenheimer like a magician. The tempo of the movie along with its wave-natured background score using it to pump your adrenaline at key moments.

Of course, Nolan is the most misogynistic he could ever be having women characters who spout about nothing more than Men. It's just pathetic and in no way do I think these films will hold up. Maybe as a means to see some glimpse of a historical event, but nothing more than that. No heart. No thing to latch on to. No interest whatsoever in Nolan's interests at all.

If you hate flashbacks and jumps in time, you have to suck it up. The tension between Oppy and Teller over the \"h-bomb\" is a great sub-plot. Dr Lawrence of \"Lawrence-Livermore\" labs is seen more in this film than in other versions of the Manhattan project.

As a Director and cinematographer he continually pushes the boundaries in search of perfection and wants his team and the actors to go with him. Sometimes he'll win and sometimes he won't but he doesn't patronise his audience. Yet again this is another of his films where you'll need a second or third viewing to fully enjoy the nuances and interactions that evolve. Murphy leads brilliantly and all the support and ensemble cast are portrayed very well. The script is deep and the meaning that one can take from the experience is multi-layered. The movie has different facets that will appeal from the use of colour and B/W to the powerful score. The sound is amazing in IMAX albeit can overwhelm the narrative (a recent and I'd say valid gripe against Nolan). The story arc is not linear, a classic Nolan feature which I like and the pay-off is haunting.

Robert Oppenheimer and portrayed brilliantly by Cillian Murphy, is a true triumph in both storytelling and historical accuracy. Nolan's meticulous attention to detail brings to life the complexity of Oppenheimer's role in the development of the atomic bomb, capturing the ethical dilemmas, scientific breakthroughs, and personal struggles he faced. Murphy's performance is nothing short of exceptional, capturing Oppenheimer's brilliance and internal conflicts with remarkable depth. The film's seamless blend of historical events and emotional exploration makes it an unparalleled cinematic experience. From its stunning visuals to its thought-provoking narrative, this film stands as a testament to Nolan's directorial prowess and a testament to one of history's most pivotal moments. In short, a masterpiece that redefines the biographical genre.\",\n",

All other actors have done good job. Music is atmospheric and blends well with the scenes, except for a few instances where it gets too loud and annoying. Nolan should make more movies which are character-driven like Oppenheimer and The Prestige, instead of making soulless sci-fi garbage like Interstellar.\",\n",

This film portrays an atomic bomb that destroys Nagasaki and Hiroshima, we all know about the story of it and how terrifying and dreadful it is then Nolan decided to present things that most people didn't know or were interested in, he decided to portray the insight of the inside story about a man who creates a nuclear bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. And it is outcome intellectual. My favorite scene wouldn't be any scene but the bomb testing scene, it's so spectacular and made my jaw drop. However, I think this film isn't so complex compares to other Nolan films but that's not my complaint at all.

This is hands down the biggest disappointment of a movie in years, and I am usually a fan of Nolan. This film touched on none of the interesting aspects of this subject. No mention of the demon core, no mention of the science and knowledge it took to make any of this happen, no mention of the ethical and moral implications and consequences most scientists felt. This film drags on for hours while never deserving to do so. Anyone who says they like this movie is a phony intellectual neckbeard.\",\n",

There were so many stories that could have been told about Oppenheimer, but the way they told the story was so respectful yet captured so many important aspects of his life. With all the controversy, complexity, and mystery that surrounds this story, be it politics, ethics, or science, this film artfully layered it's scenes with a deep understanding, using metaphors and parallels that left me reeling with contemplation. There are so many layers, that this film can be a completely different movie depending upon how much of this story you knew before, yet still leave you dumbfounded by how beautifully these messages are delivered. The cast is nothing short of magnificent. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorites, but this may be his best yet.

Either way i would recommend you to watch the movie so that you can understande the \"hype\" behind it.

The human element of progress often comes at a price, and those responsible must live with the results both good and bad.\\n\\nThis movie immediately goes into my personal Top 5.

It's boring, overdone and chaotic. The timelines intertwine so that you can't figure out what times you are watching. We watch characters talk to each other and discuss what others have said. Oppenheimer himself has been made into a slightly crazy type who basically doesn't know why he is working on the atomic bomb. I still don't know what his motivation was, it was so hard to tell from the acting. Well, that's right, the acting. With so many excellent actors, Nolan gives us such flat and poorly drawn characters. Oppenheimer's wives, in particular, look like characters artificially glued to the plot. They might as well not have been there and the film would have lost nothing and gained nothing. Unfortunately, I will not recommend this film. It is probably the worst Nolan film I have seen.\",\n",

With the outstanding performance of cillian murphy as usual and the magnificent cast in every single role.

Really have to pay careful attention to what is going on, the pacing was constant but tells a great story. The reference to JFK at the end I really appreciated after watching Kevin Costners masterpiece recently.

The movie uses no CGI and show real explositions of bombs and it is better than what any CGI could make. It is also very philosophical in its thinking about the threat that the bombs make.

Like Jonathan Glazer's upcoming The Zone of Interest, this is a film in which the horrors of war are not shown but conveyed inescapably through what we hear. Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's score is masterful and mercurial, surely one of the finest of the year. And there's a recurring motif in the soundscape, a crescendo of thunderously stamping feet.

However, if you don't like dialogue driven movies then this might not be for you, but I would still recommend you see this work of art. It is a mature story with some sex scenes but if you're 14, mature 13 I would say it's fine.\",\n",

The cast was picked perfectly and served amazing acting. Personally I didn't find it too long, in fact it didn't feel like 3h at all. Would strongly recommend watching it in theaters rather than waiting to stream it at home. Also wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not into history at all. No need to be a history buff, but would recommend looking up the some information about the Manhattan Project and everybody's involvement just for a better feel of the plot, though one can watch the movie without any prior knowledge whatsoever.

Overall i think the movie was as good as expected, but might not be great if not viewed in a cinema, as it really needs good audio to help stay focused. Good not great, could be better, but still strongly recommend to see it.',\n",
       "  \"The character assassination of Julius Robert Oppenheimer is a much described and debated subject, and it's basically also what this film is about, I think, and little about nuclear bomb making. Nevertheless, though it's nearly three hours long, director Christopher Nolan still tries to fill the plot with more than is possible, and the results is that it stylistically appears like an endless trailer, where the editing and the jumping in time looks more like a long music video than an epic film. At times it becomes distressing to watch, and it's a great relief when this cannonade of pictures takes breaks in a few longer and slower sequences. If the intention has been to illustrate the main character's inner life during the process, it's perhaps reasonable, but this great topic would probably fit better as a mini series. However, Cillian Murphy makes the very best out of it as Oppenheimer, and despite the aggressive editing he manages to build a credible character. Sadly it doesn't work too well for several other characters, who also are more or less miscasted.\",\n",
       "  'I\\'ve heard that a big deterrent to watch this movie is it\\'s 3 hour run time, however, I believe that those 3 hours make up one of the most important films in cinema history. Oppenheimer is a hard-to-swallow biopic on one of mankind\\'s most important men to ever live, and every second of this film is nothing short of accurate history (from big factual sources like the book \"American Prometheus\" which in itself is the biggest inspiration for this film) combined with Christopher Nolan\\'s remarkable story telling. This is a movie you do NOT want to miss. Also, don\\'t forget to watch it on its intended format (70mm or IMAX)',\n",

The score is phenomenal, the sound design is exhilarating, the set design is incredible, the performances are BEYOND AMAZING. This movie will 100% dominate in the awards season. I can guarantee that Cillian Murphy will take home best actor with Robert Downey Jr taking home the best supporting actor. This is a master class in cinema and needs to be seen on the biggest screen imaginable.\",\n",

Personally, the experience I had with the film, I do not think it will be repeated, because it is so great, the sound, the great photography, the impressive embodiment of the actors, and the scene of the bombing that is difficult to forget. A masterpiece from Nolan's masterpieces, one of the best biographical films in history because it was presented in a distinctive way by Nolan with his special touches. Personally, I will watch the movie two or three times in the cinema. And my personal rating for the movie is 10/10. I recommend watching the movie in the cinema, specifically in the IMAX, to live the best possible cinematic experience.\",\n",

This is one of his best work yet, and you could argue that it is the best movie ever. The acting and story telling was perfect. Nolan and Murphy did a good job in portraying Dr. Oppenheimer as a character and personality. All the other actors did a fantastic job as well as their role I could see that all of the actors knew what they were doing.

       "  'Making quality historical biopics is hard. First, a director wants to be true to history. Second, a director wants to entertain a broad audience. So here, master director Chris Nolan took on the task of a biopic of Robert Oppenheimer - the \"father of the atomic bomb\". I am sure the movie will get an oscar nod or two. But for this reviewer, it fell short of that lofty mark. First major flaw was the length of the film. It ran THREE HOURS. Yikes. I would almost go so far as to say no movie should run that long. That may go too far, but as to this particular film, the key part of the Oppenheimer life story should have taken 2 hours. Second major flaw, at least in IMAX, was a loud \"boomy\" audio that made dialogue tough to follow. \"Boomy\" bass is fine for atomic test explosions and the like, but not for dialogue. With that said, the quality of acting by Cilian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and others was natural and convincing. I won\\'t fault them.',\n",

The way the movie portrayed Oppenheimers character is just wonderful the making of atomic bomb the consequences he imagined after wards and the fear of having bloods in his hands the corrupt system of being jealous of another's work and forcing to work into it more false accusations on Oppenheimer by lewis strauus..you won't regret watching this movie.\",\n",

The rest of the cast was fantastic as well, special mention to Robert Downey Jr. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt all give an excellent performance. Ludwid Gorranson's score sends chill throughout the body. My only issue was with the sound mixing. In certain parts the score gets a bit too loud that it's a bit difficult to listen to the dialogue between the actors, but it won't be an issue if subtitles are shown. Overall outstanding movie and expect at least 3-4 Academy award nominations. 9.6/10.\",\n",
       "  \"Personally, i think Christopher Nolan is the best director of all time. You have a different experience in each of his movies. The cast is great and this movie was one of my first times seeing Cillian Murphy and he was spectacular to say the least. It felt like every expression had a meaning. His performance will be talked a lot over the years. RDJ stole the show every scene he was in and i wish he got more screen time. Although the movie was dialogue driven every dialogue and every scene was like an action scene courtesy of Nolan. And the music REALLY helped this film given most of the movie was based on dialogues. I'm gonna watch the movie for the second time tomorrow because i couldn't get all the information and couldn't completely understand the film although it was pretty straightforward. There were a lot of stuff to unpack in the movie. I liked it very much and i highly suggest you watch this movie.\",\n",

All actors did a phenomenal job, Cillian Murphy was simply fantastic, Robert Downy Jr. Was so versatile and the entire supporting cast delivered their best and it was impactful. The long 3 hour runtime didn't feel long at all in fact it had me hooked from the start till the end, there was no scene that was boring or dragged out. Christopher Nolan proving once again that he is one of the best in this age, this may be his best work yet.\\n\\nThis movie deserves all the praise that it's getting.\",\n",
       "  \"The acting in this film is fascinating and the cast is absolutely stellar. It's an interesting story and certainly would have deserved a 9 were it not for two major flaws that are common in movies these days but taken to absurd excess here. First, the sound. It was so muffled and echoey, and the music and sound effects were so overwhelming, that my friends and I missed at least a third of the dialog. Since the drama depended on the dialog, this was a serious error in judgment. At times, it was obvious something very humorous was occurring in the dialog, but the entire audience just sat in confused silence trying to figure out what was going on. And then there were the frequent changes in scene. Just as you are settling into a scene, suddenly the story jumps to a different city, with different people, in a different decade. Between the inaudible dialog and the frenetic changes in scene, the film was often difficult to follow. I look forward to watching this with subtitles to see what I missed.\",\n",
       "  \"I was expecting more coverage of the physics and leadership of Dr O. Instead Nolan seems singularly focused on setting the record straight on Oppenheimer. A great cast but the constant switch back and forth to scenes from the past plus conversations drowned by background music, and a focus on the conspiracies surrounding Oppenheimer, got a bit tiring. I expected a different movie. One that used imax to its maximum. I could've just watched this at home, with subtitles to aid my comprehension of otherwise hard-to-hear dialog.\\n\\nThis movie was over-hyped. It is okay for a director to interpret rather than illustrate since it's not a documentary, but that cannot be at the expense of telling the full story. I will be wary of watching new movies from Nolan going forward. Your mileage might vary, but I am not a fan.\",\n",
       "  \"You can draw modern-day parallels with Artificial Intelligence and (the inaction of) Climate Change that threatens humanity. More specifically, nations that still see it opportune to rely on fossil fuels and coal as they grow their economy as time to prevent our planet being uninhabitable is running out. Oppenheimer is brilliant with its fantastic visuals, immersive score, and pulsating dialogue.\\n\\nI've found myself hanging onto every word of a three hour movie, due to the urgency that Christopher Nolan cultivates throughout the film. By the time you put the pieces together of what is going on, you find yourself in the same bind that J Robert Oppenheimer is in. The way the film escalates and finishes with a weighty parting scene will leave you to contemplate the trajectory of humanity, and whether or not we can stop a seemingly insurmountable problem. 10/10.\",\n",

But thinking it twice, the narrative frame is so good that the 2h45 seemed not so long and the global story was not annoying or boring...of course Nolan could have cut 30 minutes to make it more mainstream but the film editing is great. A contemplative experience as usual with Nolan but Cylian Murphy is so good and Robert Downey is a credible Lewis Strauss. I would not view it again on TV but I would pay for 70mm version in theater. The pre requisite of non using special effects can be disturbing as we are waiting for that bomb to explode for 2 hours but the outcome can be disappointing for some people.
